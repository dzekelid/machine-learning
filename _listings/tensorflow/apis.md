description: TensorFlow&trade; is an open source software library for numerical computation
  using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while
  the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated
  between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one
  or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API.

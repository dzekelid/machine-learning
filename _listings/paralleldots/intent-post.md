    ```

    # Authentication
    What is the preferred way of using the API?

    An API key is required to be sent as a parameter to authenticate your requests.


    # Rate limit
    Is there a limit to the number of requests an user can send?

    There is no rate limit as such but too many concurrent requests will throw 504 time-out error from nginx.

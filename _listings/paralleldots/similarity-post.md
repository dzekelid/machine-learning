    # Introduction
    What does your API do?

    Semantic Analysis API helps users cluster similar articles by understanding the relatedness between different content and streamlines research by eliminating redundant text contents.

    # Overview
    Things that the developers should know about

    The API accepts the input parameters as form-data.

    Response will be in JSON as shown below:

    ```
    {
      "usage": "By accessing ParallelDots API or using information generated by ParallelDots API, you are agreeing to be bound by the ParallelDots API Terms of Use: http://www.paralleldots.com/terms-and-conditions",
      "actual_score": 0.842932,
      "normalized_score": 4.931469
    }

    ```

    # Authentication
    What is the preferred way of using the API?

    An API key is required to be sent as a parameter to authenticate your requests.

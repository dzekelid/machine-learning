    # Introduction
    What does your API do?

    Custom Classifier API accepts input text, categories with a list of sub-categories and API key to return a JSON response classifying the input text into categories provided.

    # Overview
    Things that the developers should know about

    The API accepts the input parameters as form-data. Providing sub-categories is optional, send an empty array ('[]') in case you do want to add any sub-categories to your category.

    Response will be in JSON sorted by confidence score as shown below:

    ```
    {
        "usage": "By accessing ParallelDots API or using information generated by ParallelDots API, you are agreeing to be bound by the ParallelDots API Terms of Use: http://www.paralleldots.com/terms-and-conditions",
        "taxonomy": [
            {
                "tag": "world politics",
                "confidence_score": 0.622804
            },
            {
                "tag": "finance",
                "confidence_score": 0.325811
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    # Authentication
    What is the preferred way of using the API?

    An API key is required to be sent as a parameter to authenticate your requests.


    # Rate limit
    Is there a limit to the number of requests an user can send?

    There is no rate limit as such but too many concurrent requests will throw 504 time-out error from nginx.

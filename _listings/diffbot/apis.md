description: Diffbot provides a set of APIs that enable developers to easily use web
  data in their own applications. Diffbot analyzes documents much like a human would,
  using the visual properties to determine how the parts of the page fit together.
  The algorithm uses statistical techniques to automatically and reliably determine
  the structural organization of a page, independent of layout and the language of
  the text.
